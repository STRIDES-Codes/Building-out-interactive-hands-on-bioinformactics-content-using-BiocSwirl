  Output: Before we start working with the data, we need to install the following packages:
  Bioconductor and minfi.

- Class: cmd_question
  # 
  Output: Open a new R project and install the packages: Bioconductor and minfi
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install("minfi")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(install.packages("BiocManager"),install.packages
  ("minfi"))

  Hint: Google Bioconductor and minfi

  Output:First, let's load an example of the methylation array data which is saved as an RDS file called `meth_data_samples.csv`.  
  This dataset is a cleaned subset of data that can be found in the
  Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) publicly available database (GSE39141). The dataset consists of 
  the beta values which are estimates of methylation levels for 485,577 CpG sites from eight samples- four healthy controls
  and 4 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Store it as an object named 'meth_data_samples'
   CorrectAnswer:meth_data_samples = readRDS("meth_data_samples.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='meth_data_samples = readRDS("meth_data_samples.csv")')
  Hint: use readRDS and store it as an object named meth_data_samples
  

- Class: text_question
  Output: Create a density plot of the beta values 
  CorrectAnswer: minfi::densityPlot("meth_data_samples")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='densityPlot(meth_data_samples)')
  Hint: use minfi::densityPlot()
  
 - Class: figure
  Output: This figure shows the average beta value densities of the different samples. A beta value falls between 0 and 1 with most density on extreme ends. Higher quality samples should have a plot with samples of similar beta values and higher density on the extreme ends.

- Class: text_question
  Output: A density bean plot is another way of visualizing the above data for QC. Try plotting one.
  CorrectAnswer: minfi::densityBeanPlot("meth_data_samples")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='densityBeanPlot(meth_data_samples)')
  Hint: use minfi::densityBeanPlotPlot()
  
- - Class: figure
  Output: This figure shows the average beta value densities of the different samples using a Bean plot. Most densities should be in the extreme (larger bean shapes on the extrema).
