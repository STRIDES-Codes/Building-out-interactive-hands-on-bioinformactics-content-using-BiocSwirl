  Output: Types of input data Phenotypic Data & Genotypic Data & Types of Output Manhattan plots
  
- Class: text
  Output: Phenotype data looks like 

- Class: text
  Output: Genotype data can be in many formats like genotype data in hapmap format; genotype data in numerical format; genotype map; kinship; covariate variables 

- Class: text
  Output: We will use hapmap format where the SNP information (chromosome and position) and genotype of each taxa to be stored in one file.

  Output: SNP name , the chrom column and the pos are used

  Output: 
    analysis
    General Linear Model (GLM)
    Mixed Linear Model (MLM)
    Compressed MLM (CMLM)
    Enriched CMLM (ECMLM)
    Settlement of MLM Under Progressively Exclusive Relationship (SUPER)
    Fixed and random model Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU)
    Bayesian-information and Linkagedisequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK)
    We would not explain these models one can get inference from which they find suitable, anyhow litrature suggests BLINK > FarmCPU> MLMM > SUPER > ECMLM > CMLM > MLM > GLM.
